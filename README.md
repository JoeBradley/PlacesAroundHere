# PlacesAroundHere

A simple single page app for showing Google Street View images for a place on a map, and the surrounding area (100 metre radius).  
By selecting a central point on the map, 16 surrounding points are selected at a radius of 50m and 100 m.  
Then Google street view images for these point are displayed. 

The intention of the app is to allow you to quickly get a sense of what an area of a city is like; is it an industrial area,
are their houses, is it resendential, are their apartment bildings, is it a shopping area.  
So if you are looking to rent or buy in a city, but don't really know what the different kietz are like, then this can help a little.

Limitations:
Not all map markers will show an image, but rather show a grey image.
If several people use this, the free google api key will probably stop working, and I don't want to pay for it.
